# r_and_p_versioning
Repository for paper "Replication materials are great but software versioning still poses a problem for open science" 

## Reproducing the results from the original paper

The Dockerfile inside the `dockerfile` folder can be used to build an image based on rhub/rig that makes 
it easy to install the required R version. The original script had to be slightly adapted to output the 
results of interest that we need to compare between Râ€¯version 3.5 and R version 3.6. Results obtained
using R version 4.2 are also provided (are aligned with R 3.6)
